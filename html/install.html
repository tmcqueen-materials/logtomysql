      <h2>Install</h2>
<ol>

<li><p>Make sure you have Apache installed, and can edit its configuration file, 
   usually it is something like</p>

   <p>/etc/httpd/httpd.conf<br>
   or <br> 
   /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf</p>
</li>

<li><p>Make sure you have MySQL 4 installed and can edit its configuration file, usually 
   it is something like</p>

   <p>/etc/my.cnf</p>

   <p>You need to have the development libraries for MySQL available. If you installed 
   it from source this is no problem, but if you installed from RPMs or other 
   packages, you should check that the development packages are installed. Note that LogToMysql 
   will only work with MySQL version 4.0 and above.</p></li>

<li><p>Untar/unzip the LogToMysql software into wherever you like to compile software.</p></li>

<li><p>Edit the LogToMysql Makefile to correctly point to the headers and libraries for 
   MySQL on your system. Typical locations to look in are</p>

   <p>Includes:<br>
        /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql<br>
        /usr/local/include/mysql<br>
        /usr/include/mysql</p>
   <p>Libraries:<br>
        /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql<br>
        /usr/local/lib/mysql<br>
        /usr/lib/mysql</p></li>

<li><p>Type <br>
        make</p>

   <p>This should compile everything in a couple of seconds. If you are having 
   problems with the MySQL libraries not being found it can help to set up the 
   directories</p>

   <p>  /usr/local/include/mysql<br>
        /usr/local/lib/mysql</p>

   <p>and copy or link the required files from wherever your distribution has put them.</p></li>

<li><p>Two executable files are produced </p>
	
        <p>logtomysql<br>
        logerrortomysql</p>

   <p>for access logs and error logs respectively. Copy these to</p>

   <p>/usr/local/bin</p>

   <p>and make sure that root (or whichever user Apache starts as) can execute them.</p></li>

<li><p>Set up the MySQL database for logging. Assuming that you are connected to the 
   MySQL server with permissions to create a database and user for logging, type 
   the following to set up your database (change passwords and IP numbers for your 
   set-up):</p>

       <p>CREATE DATABASE weblog;</p>

   <p>For logging on the local machine</p>
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON weblog.* TO weblogger@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';</p>
   <p>or if logging to a remote machine from 192.168.0.2</p>
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON weblog.* TO weblogger@192.168.0.2 IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';</p>

       <p>CREATE TABLE log (hostname text,datetime varchar(100),<br>
                  url text,refer text,agent varchar(150),<br>
                  ident varchar(150),resp_code int unsigned,xfer_size int unsigned);</p>
       <p>CREATE TABLE errorlog (datetime timestamp(14) NOT NULL, message varchar(255));</p>

   <p>If you need to use an existing user or database, just create the tables, and modify the 
   options in section (8) below to match.</p></li>

<li><p>LogToMysql reads passwords and other configuration information from the MySQL 
   configuration file. Details of the entries are:</p>

   <ul>
   <li> Socket is the local unix socket for connections to MySQL running on the same server as 
     Apache. Set to NULL if logging to a remote machine.</li>

   <li> Database is the name of the database in which your log files will be stored. It needs 
     to agree with whatever you set up in section 7.</li>

   <li> Host is 'localhost' or remote host IP on which MySQL is running.</li>

   <li> Port should be 0 for logging to the localhost using a socket, otherwise, 3306 for a 
     standard MySQL installation on a remote machine.</li>

   <li> User is the MySQL user name through which logging will take place. It needs to agree 
     with whatever you set up in section 7.</li>

   <li> Password is the MySQL user password. It needs to agree with whatever you set up in 
     section 7.</li>

   <li> Logging is the level of information generated by the LogToMysql programs and send to 
     their log files. It has nothing to do with the Apache logging level. Set to zero for 
     minimal information, 1 for important messages, and 2 to show you all the queries sent 
     to MySQL. Level 1 is usually best.</li>

   <li> Logfile is the place that LogToMysql programs will use to store their log information. 
     Different files are needed for logtomysql and logerrortomysql.</li>

   <li> Sysuser and sysgroup are the username and group under which logtomysql and 
     logerrortomysql will run once they have started. Just like Apache itself, it is best 
     to avoid running these logging programs as root.</li>

   </ul>
   <p>Examples of the configuration information are below, which you will need to edit for your 
   system. Examples are given for logging on the same machine as the Apache installation, 
   and for logging to a remote machine.</p>

   <p><b>Example 1:</b><br>

   If MySQL is running on the same machine as the Apache server, edit and copy the lines 
   below into /etc/my.cnf (or whichever file is used on your system). Set the 'socket' to 
   match the value in the [mysqld] section of my.cnf.</p>

   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">[logtomysql]<br>
   socket          = /tmp/mysql.sock<br>
   database        = weblog<br>
   host            = localhost <br> 
   port            = 0   <br>
   user            = weblogger<br>
   password        = secret<br>
   logging         = 1<br>
   logfile         = /tmp/logtomysql.log<br>
   sysuser         = apache<br>
   sysgroup        = apache</font></p>

   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">[logerrortomysql]<br>
   socket          = /tmp/mysql.sock<br>
   database        = weblog<br>
   host            = localhost  <br>
   port            = 0   <br>
   user            = weblogger<br>
   password        = secret<br>
   sysuser         = apache<br>
   sysgroup        = apache<br>
   logfile         = /tmp/logerrortomysql.log<br>
   logging         = 1</font></p>

   <p><b>Example 2:</b><br>

   If MySQL is on a remote machine, edit and copy the lines below into /etc/my.cnf ON THE 
   MACHINE ON WHICH APACHE IS RUNNING. Create the file if it doesn't exist. Change 'host' to 
   the machine on which MySQL is running.</p>


   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">[logtomysql]<br>
   socket          = NULL<br>
   database        = weblog<br>
   host            = 192.168.0.3<br>
   port            = 3306<br>
   user            = weblogger<br>
   password        = secret<br>
   logging         = 1<br>
   logfile         = /tmp/logtomysql.log<br>
   sysuser         = apache<br>
   sysgroup        = apache</font></p>

   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">[logerrortomysql]<br>
   socket          = NULL<br>
   database        = weblog<br>
   host            = 192.168.0.3<br>
   port            = 3306<br>
   user            = weblogger<br>
   password        = secret<br>
   sysuser         = apache<br>
   sysgroup        = apache<br>
   logfile         = /tmp/logerrortomysql.log<br>
   logging         = 1</font></p>


   <p>When logging both access and errors both sections of options are needed, even though 
   there might be duplication between them. If you only want to log access just include the 
   [logtomysql] and not the [logerrortomysql], and visa versa if you just want to log 
   errors.</p></li>

<li><p>Configure Apache to use the piped logs.</p>

   <p><b>Access Logs</b><br>
   Anywhere that you would normally use piped logs, use lines like the ones below to use 
   LogToMysql. This works in both server wide and virtual server domains.</p>

   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined<br>
   CustomLog "|/usr/local/bin/logtomysql" combined</font></p>

   <p>making sure that the logtomysql binary is in the place you enter here.</p>

   <p><b>Error Logs</b><br>
   Using logerrortomysql in the server wide ErrorLog directive is dangerous, and likely to 
   cause you trouble. This is because the server may attempt to log information during 
   start-up before the piped logging process is fully up and running. Virtual hosts for SSL 
   are particularly bad at causing trouble this way.</p>

   <p>To prevent problems use a file based ErrorLog directive for the server wide 
   configuration, and then put a logerrortomysql based ErrorLog directive inside each 
   virtual host. Example:</p>

   <p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">#Virtual host for SSL<br>
   &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;<br>
   #Rest of virtual host config goes here<br>
   LogLevel warn<br>
   ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/logerrortomysql"<br>
   &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;<br>
   #Virtual host for port 80<br>
   &lt;/VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br>
   #Rest of virtual host config goes here<br>
   LogLevel warn<br>
   ErrorLog "|/usr/local/bin/logerrortomysql"<br>
   &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;<br>
   #Server wide error log<br>
   ErrorLog /usr/local/apache/logs/error_log </font></p>

   <p>Again, make sure that the logerrortomysql binary is in the place you enter in the 
   httpd.conf file.</p></li>

<li><p>Start or re-start Apache</p>
   <p>Once you have set all this up, restart Apache and logging will begin to the database.  
   If it doesn't, see <a href="trouble.html">troubleshooting</a>.</p></li>
