      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>



<p>There is lots of configuration to do, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work first time. 
Some things to try are:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Check your MySQL log-in details are working OK by starting a MySQL console from the 
   machine running Apache (assuming the standard text based client is available on that 
   machine), e.g.</p>

   <p>for localhost running MySQL<br>
       <font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">mysql -u weblogger -p </font></p>

   <p>for MySQL running on a remote host (change the IP to match your set-up)<br>
       <font face="courier new,courier,monospace;">mysql -u weblogger -p -P 3306 -h 192.168.0.2</font></p>

   <p>If you can't log in this way, LogToMysql probably won't be able to either. Check you 
   created the MySQL user with the right name and password. If running Apache and MySQL on 
   separate machines check that the user is allowed to connect from the IP number of the 
   machine on which LogToMysql will run (i.e. the machine running Apache).</p></li>

<li><p>Check the LogToMysql log files for clues. The location of these files is specified in 
   the my.cnf file. If the log files don't exist, check that the files pointed to in the  
   Apache config file (e.g. "|/usr/local/bin/logerrortomysql") actually exist, and are 
   executable by root.</p></li>

<li><p>Check that when the server starts, it is starting MySQL before it starts Apache. If MySQL 
   is not running when Apache starts, the logerrortomysql process cannot find MySQL, and it then may die. 
   Grsecurity (built into some Linux kernels) will kill logerrortomysql in this case because it 
   is trying to access MySQL using a socket which doesn't exist until MySQL starts. See the startup 
   scripts in (usually in /etc/rc.d/) to sort this out.</p>
   <p>On systems without Grsecurity versions of logtomysql 0.95 and after should continue to run until 
   MySQL becomes available, and will then re-establish a database connection.</p>
</li>

<li><p>Check that my.cnf is readable and contains all the required information under the correct  
   headings. All the lines shown in the examples should be included. If logging to a remote 
   machine, make sure that this config file is on the same machine that Apache is running on.</p></li>

<li><p>Check that there are not 2 or more copies of the Apache or MySQL config files around. 
   This can happen if you have updated the distribution using a source code install of 
   Apache or MySQL rather than the standard RPM. If there are two copies of config files, it 
   can be difficult to tell which on is really being used. For example, Apache puts its 
   config files in /usr/local/apache/conf, but many distributions put them in /etc/httpd. 
   Work out which copy you want, and append 'old' to the names of the others (don't delete 
   them in case they are useful).</p></li>

<li><p>Installation of LogToMysql along with Apache in a chroot is possible and works fine, but  
   there are some complications with making sure the MySQL socket is found, and that the 
   configuration files are inside the chroot jail, not outside it. The mysqlclient library may 
   need to be in the chroot too, depending on how the chroot is set up. An easy way to set one 
   up is with mod_security (<a href="http://www.modsecurity.org">www.modsecurity.org</a>)</p></li>
