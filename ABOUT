*About*
LogToMysql is a set of simple programs to log Apache access and errors to a 
MySQL database using the piped log mechanism. 

LogToMysql will work with both Apache 1 and Apache 2, or any other server which 
supports piped logging. 

Using LogToMysql it is possible for several computers to log to a single 
database. Both access and error log management can be simplified in this way if 
you run a large cluster of machines. The database can be on the same machine as 
Apache, or on a separate machine. 

No modification to the standard Apache install is required - no patching, no 
recompilation.

*Performance*
On an Athlon 1800 machine running both the Apache server and MySQL it was 
possible to sustain logging of over 200 hits per second without problems.
