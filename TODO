Grsecurity[8] on Mandrake 9.1 kills the error logging process on server 
startup. Access logs are not affected, and a later manual restart of Apache 
launches both error and access logging without problems.



Solution: This was caused by the server starting Apache (and hence LogToMysql) 
before MySQL. Grsecurity killed the error logging process because it was trying 
to access MySQL using a socket which hadn't yet been created. To avoid this, 
check the order in which Apache and MySQL are started, for example by looking 
at the numbered links in directories below /etc/rc.d/



== TODO == 

- Add support for logging virtual host information in access logs - currently 
only the standard "common" or "combined" log format is supported 
- Add identification of the machine from which error messages are logged. 
Currently the machine is not identified in the case of multiple computers 
logging to a single database.
