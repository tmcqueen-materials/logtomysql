*LogToMysql*
Simple programs to log Apache accesses and errors to a MySQL database using the 
piped log mechanism. 

*Overview*
This package contains two simple programs for logging from an Apache web server 
to a MySQL database using the piped logs mechanism. It can be used on either a 
single server running both Apache and MySQL, or with separate machines. If 
separate machines are used, several servers can log accesses and errors to a 
single database. 

The code may be used with both Apache versions 1 and 2, and other servers 
capable of piped logging. It is designed for "common" or "combined" access log 
formats. 

No changes are required to a standard server installation - these are stand 
alone programs not server modules. 

These programs have only been tested on Linux. They might work on Windows - let 
me know if you try this out. 

On an Athlon 1800 machine running both the Apache server and MySQL it was 
possible to sustain logging of over 200 hits per second without problems.
